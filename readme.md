# BFRHelpScoutDocsClient

### Summary
BFRHelpScoutDocsClient is a basic wrapper around the HelpScout Docs API. It requires AFNetworking as a dependency. 

Use it to pull a list of articles from HelpScout Docs, before showing the selected article to a user.

We'll be putting together a demo project to help you hook up to your HelpScout Docs shortly.

We use it in [Buffer for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/buffer-for-twitter-pinterest/id490474324?mt=8) :-).

### Going Forward
